    "audio_data = \"Pakistan is back to default. After Hawking Rare Earths at the White House, Islamabad is turning to a tried and tested strategy, blaming India. Because Pakistan's domestic situation is getting worse. There are protests in Pakistan occupied Kashmir. There are terror attacks in Balochistan. The economy is as bad as always. So, on cue, the country's Defense Minister turned to India. He says the risk of war with India is very real. Our next report tells you more. When trouble comes, Pakistan has just one response. Turn to India. And right now, Pakistan is facing a deluge of trouble. In Khyber Pakhtunkwa, there is a political and security crisis. The province is ruled by Imran Khan's PTI party, but its Chief Minister has resigned after being asked to by the party chief. Why? Over-repeated security failures. Just yesterday, the Pakistani Taliban attacked and killed 11 military personnel. It's part of a worrying trend in the province. So far, in 2025, Kaiba Pakhtunkwa has seen 605 terrorist attacks. Overall, militancy and violence in Pakistan has surged by 46% this year, and Kaiba is the worst-hit region. By asking the Chief Minister to resign, Imran Khan is hoping to appear tough. A contrast when you look at the Pakistani army failures, they seem unable to protect their own, let alone civilians. Over in Sindh, it was almost the deja vu moment this week. Militants targeted the Jaffar Express which runs from Quetta to Peshawar. A bomb blast on the railway line derailed four bogies of the train. It left at least seven passengers injured. The same train was targeted by Baloch separatists in March of 2025. They attacked and hijacked the train, holding at least 380 passengers hostage, while most were rescued, around 30 of them were killed. If you move to Pakistan occupied Kashmir, the story is equally grim. Deadly protests rocked the region last week. Those were demanding legislative reforms and cheaper food and electricity. The government responded with a brutal crackdown. It left around 12 protesters dead. All these security challenges have gripped Pakistan in the middle of an economic crisis. The World Bank has slashed the country's growth forecast. the monsoon season, it was expected to grow by 3.1%. But then came the ranks. Pakistan's Punjab province faced its worst flooding in years. As a result, the agriculture sector, the backbone of Pakistan's economy, suffered. The World Bank is now expecting the country to grow by just 2.6 percent. Amid all these crises, you would expect their leadership to focus inward, but you'd be wrong. Pakistan's military and civilian leaders are warmongering. Listen to their Defence Minister, Qawwaja Asif. I do not want escalation, but the risks are real, and I am not denying that. If it comes comes to war, we will achieve a better result than before. Pakistan's military is also saber rattling. Earlier this week, indian military officers had won pakistan against sponsoring terrorists. An innocent party would have denied the charge altogether. But not pakistan. Their military warned india of a swift response against any action. In many ways, this sums up the problem with Pakistan. The country has a hundred problems, but it keeps obsessing over the imagined threat from India. you\""
